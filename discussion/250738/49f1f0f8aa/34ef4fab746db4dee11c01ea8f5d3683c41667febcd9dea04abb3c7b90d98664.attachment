<div dir="ltr">I&#39;ve been attempting to build/deploy GM in such a way that Graphviz files are able to be processed, but so far no luck. The documentation (<a href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/README.html#add-on-libraries-programs">http://www.graphicsmagick.org/README.html#add-on-libraries-programs</a>) suggests this is supported, but doesn&#39;t provide any indication what exactly is necessary from Graphviz in order for this to work.<div><br></div><div>The build environment I&#39;m using is Ubuntu 20.04 docker container and I&#39;ve tried having libgraphviz-dev &amp; graphviz packages available at varying combinations of build and runtime, but no matter what I try DOT/Graphviz doesn&#39;t appear in output from gm convert -list formats and I see no hints in configure for how I might point the build process in the right direction. Is there a specific version/range of versions of Graphviz which are supported?</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks!</div><div><br></div><div>-Dan</div></div>
