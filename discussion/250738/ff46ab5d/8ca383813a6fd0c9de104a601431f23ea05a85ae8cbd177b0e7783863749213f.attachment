<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div>Hi,<br><br></div>I wish to use GM in an embedded app, without need for many of the formats/libraries that GM usually needs to link against. Is there a quick &amp; easy manner of disabling various external deps at compile-time? Here are the flags I wish to (at least temporarily) eliminate:<br><br>X11 Xext z gomp png bz2 webp jpeg tiff jasper lcms2 xml2 z wmflite<br><br></div>I then wish to reintroduce them one-by-one, depending on the platform. I realize that functionality will be missing, but there is no need for much of it. For example, no need for the wand interface, launching previews, compiling with OpenMP, or saving .png, .wmf, or .tiff files. However, I&#39;d love to continue using the C/C++ API as it is clean and usable.<br><br>How should someone go about this? <br><br><br></div>Thanks,<br></div>Colin<br></div>
